                            Last Updated: September 14, 2022
                            These Terms of Service (“Terms”) apply to your access to and use of the BPB TRAINING  website: bpbtraining.com (the “Website”) and mobile application (the “App”) provided by BPP TRAINING 3 LLC and our parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “BPB,” “we” or “us”), and the features, services, and programs offered through the Website and the App (collectively with the Website and App, our “Service”). By accessing or using our Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, including the mandatory arbitration provision and class action waiver in Section 14, do not access or use our Service.
                            These Terms do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with BPB or its subsidiaries or affiliates, for products, services or otherwise, including enrollment agreements or program terms that apply to enrollment in or attendance at any BPB Academy schools, camps, training, events, and other programs we offer (“Program Terms”).
                            Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information about how we collect, use and share information about you when you use the Service.
                            If you have any questions about these Terms, our Service or our events or programs, please contact us at info@bpbtraining.com.
                            <h2>1. ELIGIBILITY</h2>
                            You must be at least 13 years of age to access or use our Service. However, certain features of our Service, such as registering for BPB Academy schools, camps, training, events, and other programs we offer (“BPB Academy Programs”), require that you be 18 years of age or older and have a valid payment method that you are authorized to use. If you are accessing or using our Service on behalf of another person or on behalf of an entity, you represent that you are authorized to accept these Terms on that person or entity’s behalf and that the person or entity agrees to be responsible to us if you or the other person or entity violates these Terms.

                            Our Service may allow you to create, post, store and share content, including messages, text, photos, videos, software and other materials (collectively, "User Content"). Except for the license you grant below, and Feedback as set forth in Section 4 below, you retain all rights in and to your User Content, as between you and BPB.

When you post or otherwise share User Content on or through our Service, you understand that your User Content and any associated information (such as your username) may be visible to the public. You represent and warrant that (a) you own and control all of the rights to the User Content that you post or you otherwise have the right to post such User Content; (b) the User Content is accurate and not misleading; and (c) use and posting of the User Content you supply does not violate these Terms and will not violate any rights of or cause injury to any person or entity.

                            Is unlawful, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive, harassing, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, inflammatory, fraudulent or otherwise objectionable;

                            Enforcement of the content or conduct rules set forth in these Terms is solely at our discretion, and failure to enforce such rules in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce such rules in other instances. In addition, these rules do not create any private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Service will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules. Although we have no obligation to screen, edit or monitor User Content, we may delete or remove User Content at any time and for any reason.
                            <h2>4. FEEDBACK</h2>

We will own exclusive rights, including, without limitation, all intellectual property rights, in and to Feedback and will be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of Feedback for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you.

                            <h2>9. INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
                            You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless IMG and each of our respective officers, directors, agents, partners and employees (individually and collectively, the “IMG Parties”) from and against any loss, liability, claim, demand, damages, expenses or costs (including attorney’s fees) arising out of or related to (a) your access to or use of our Service; (b) your User Content; (c) your violation of these Terms; or (d) your violation, misappropriation or infringement of any rights of another (including intellectual property rights or privacy rights). This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between you and IMG or the other IMG Parties.
                            <h2>10. DISCLAIMERS</h2>
                            We do not control, endorse or take responsibility for any third-party content available on or linked to by our Service, including User Content.
                            Your use of our Service is at your sole risk. Our Service is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. In addition, BPB does not represent or warrant that our Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free. While BPB attempts to make your access to and use of our Service safe, we cannot and do not represent or warrant that our Service or servers are free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Service.
                            <h2>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
                            BPB and the other BPB Parties will not be liable to you under any theory of liability—whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, warranty, or otherwise—for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages or lost profits, even if BPB or the other BPB Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                            The total liability of BPB and the other BPB Parties for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, our Service, or any BPB Academy Program, regardless of the form of the action, is limited to the amount paid, if any, by you to access or use our Service or for the IMG Academy Program.
                            The limitations set forth in this Section will not limit or exclude liability for the gross negligence, fraud or intentional misconduct of BPB or the other BPB Parties or for any other matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.
                            <h2>12. RELEASE</h2>
                            To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release BPB and the other BPB Parties from responsibility, liability, claims, demands and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties. You expressly waive any rights you may have under California Civil Code § 1542 as well as any other statute or common law principles that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.
                            <h2>13. TRANSFER AND PROCESSING OF DATA
                            By accessing or using the Service, you consent to the processing, transfer and storage of information about you in and to the United States and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law.
                            <h2>14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; ARBITRATION</h2>
                            Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with BPB and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.
                            Except for small claims disputes in which you or BPB seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address, or disputes in which you or BPB seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and BPB waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, our Service, or any BPB Academy Program resolved in court. Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms, our Service, or any BPB Academy Program will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in the Borough of Manhattan, New York in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“Rules”) of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), which are available on the JAMS website and hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
                            You and BPB agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, our Service, or any BPB Academy Program is personal to you and BPB and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.
                            You and BPB agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 14 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the "FAA"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. You and BPB agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and BPB will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by BPB, BPB will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and BPB agree that the state or federal courts of the State of New York and the United States sitting in the borough of Manhattan have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.
                            Any claim you may have arising out of or related to these Terms, our Service, or any BPB Academy Program must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred, which means that you and BPB will not have the right to assert the claim.
                            You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 14 by emailing info@imgacademy.com. In order to be effective, the opt out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 15.
                            <h2>15. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE</h2>
                            These Terms and your access to and use of our Service and BPB Academy Programs will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Florida, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of Florida or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of Tallahassee, Florida
                             
                            <h2>16. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS</h2>
                            We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will post the amended Terms to our Service and update the “Last Updated” date above. We may also attempt to notify you by sending an email notification to the address associated with your account or providing notice through our Service. Unless we say otherwise in our notice, the amended Terms will be effective immediately and your continued access to and use of our Service after we provide notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop accessing and using our Service.
                             
                            <h2>17. TERMINATION</h2>
                            We reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate your right to access or use the Service. We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access or use our Service.
                            <h2>18. SEVERABILITY</h2>
                            If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
                            <h2>19. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
                            These Terms, together with any applicable Program Terms, constitute the entire agreement between you and BPB relating to your access to and use of our Service. The failure of BPB to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
                            <h2>20. ADDITIONAL EULA TERMS APPLICABLE TO IPHONE, IPOD TOUCH OR IPAD APPLICATIONS</h2>

The parties acknowledge that to the extent that there are any applicable warranties, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any such applicable warranty would be the sole responsibility of BPB.

                            <h5> g.
